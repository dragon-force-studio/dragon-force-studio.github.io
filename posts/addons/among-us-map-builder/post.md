This map currently have few systems running:

• Win/lose condition made automatic

• Starting the game is automatic

• Color choosing

• Multiple maps in single world

• Dead body reporting

Future plans for this map:

• Tasking system

• Voting system

For now in this map you have to manually do these:

• Task, you can do something like retrieve all items, kill all pigs, etc. When the task is done, you can do /function crewmates\_win

• Voting system, vote in the chat, ask world owner to /kill a person
