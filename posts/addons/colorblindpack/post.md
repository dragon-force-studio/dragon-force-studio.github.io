This pack emulates youtuber Georgenotfound’s colorblindness.

If you dont know, Georgenotfound is a minecraft youtuber, alongside with Dream, BadboyHalo and Sapnap. George has a colorblind when one stream he took a colorblind test. And the result shows that he cannot see color red or green. This is what I’m trying to emulate with this pack

This pack applies filter so that no color RED and GREEN in the world. Even on the UIs. By applying filter to every blocks and items and UIs in the resource pack.

**Why would I ever want this pack?**
------------------------------------

Sometimes doing stuffs like this could give more challenge to your minecraft gameplay. For example, you can’t tell which team is which, because some teams can have similar colors. That’s what people with colorblindness see, well not all of them, but some. This one is called **Protanopia**

**Am I free to do anything to this pack?**
------------------------------------------

**Well, besides re-uploading it and selling it, there’s pretty much no restrictions, as long as you give me credits, and also tell me in the comments below what you do with it. You can credit me by adding my youtube channel somewhere. The link is** [https://youtube.com/Hanprogramer](https://youtube.com/Hanprogramer)
